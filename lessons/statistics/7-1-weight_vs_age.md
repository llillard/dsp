[Think Stats Chapter 7 Exercise 1](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2008.html#toc70) (weight vs. age)

# My conclusions:

# 1) As one would expect, the scatter plot shows that there is no relationship, or at best a very week relationship
#    between the age of an individual and their weight.  Both the Person's and Spearman's correlations support these
#    findings as well.  With a Person's corr or .07 and a Spearman' s corr of .09 both indicating a non-relationsip 
#    between the two variables.
